# DevOps_Course_2024

## Overview 

This guide gives an overview of my journey through the course that I took on DevOps during this year. It focuses on core concepts, tools, and skills that I have learned, as well as practical applications and insights.

Please feel free to explore the materials and projects that I have completed in order to gain a better understanding of my DevOps experience.


## Blog Summaries:

### 1. **Docker vs Podman: What To Choose?**
This blog compares Docker and Podman, focusing on architecture, security, building images, and its performance. Docker relies on a daemon and, therefore, needs root access. Podman is daemonless and rootless with better security features. Docker offers an integrated solution, whereas Podman comes with modular tools like Buildah and Skopeo. As Podman is more resource friendly and faster in comparison to Docker, the above recommendations become valuable for secure, light environments, whereas Docker is mostly suitable for established workflows and deployments.

### 2. **Installing Minikube (Kubernetes Kernel Distribution) on Windows**
This blog post guides the process of setting up Minikube on Windows to facilitate local testing and development on Kubernetes. It simplifies running a cluster locally by using any of the available virtualization options such as Hyper-V or WSL2. Prerequisites to install the blog include enabling virtualization, installing Docker (optional), and getting kubectl set up. It also goes through the installation process and how to start and interact with the Kubernetes cluster using both kubectl and Minikube commands. By using Minikube, it shows how to efficiently simulate environments for developing and learning on a local machine.
